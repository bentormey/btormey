### Introduction

I was never interested in finance when I was younger, I had no desire to make a lot of money or spend my time doing anything other than mathematics.

Financial mathematics was a passing curiosity, I read a couple of books on stochastic calculus and pricing options, but I never considered putting that knowledge into practise.

I was drawn to the theorems, not the idea of making a profit.

But I always saved money consistently, I even had a share ISA set up that gave me exposure to the stock market.

When 2008 hit and people were queuing up to withdraw cash from their banks, I found that I had less money in that ISA than when I started.

That soured me on investing in the stock market and I didn't think about it again for a long time.

Nothing presented here constitutes investment advice, consider it a starting point for your own investigations.

Always do your own research before investing in any financial products.

### Passive vs. Active

When most people think about investing in stocks, they imagine buying shares of individual companies like Apple or Tesla.

Picking stocks, actively trading, using leverage...

The ROI on learning how to become a successful trader is low for most people.

Monetising your existing skillset through a job or your own business, generating cashflow to deploy in a passive strategy, is almost always better.

You could spend a lot of time and effort doing research on stocks, learning how to construct a portfolio around them, and managing your positions...

### Asset Classes

Restrict the universe of things we can invest in to asset classes, broadly speaking the ... ones I look at are:

- Stocks
- Bonds
- Gold
- Cash

There are others, including real estate, commodities (like oil), and cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin).

You don't need exposure to all of them, you only need a mix of assets which are not highly correlated with each other.

If you own property, you're already exposed to real estate. If you have a mortgage then you have leveraged exposure to real estate.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are vehicles for getting exposure to these broad asset classes.

Stock ETFs track major indicies, like the S&P 500 or FTSE 100, and allow you to achieve the same returns as the market on the whole...

If large-cap US companies perform well, your S&P 500 index tracking ETF performs well...

If Apple represents 5% of the index then for every $100 you invest in the ETF, $5 goes towards buying Apple shares.

Bond ETFs hold a basket of bonds, which don't trade like stocks...

Gold ETFs typically purchase physical gold...

### The 'All Weather' Portfolio

The All Weather portfolio is built on the assumption that you can't know what kind of market regime will occur in the future, but you can allocate to assets that will perform well under each different regime.

It looks like this:

- 40% long-term bonds
- 30% stocks
- 15% intermediate-term bonds
- 7.5% gold
- 7.5% commodities

Each component is selected on it's ability to weather:

- Rising economic growth
- Declining economic growth
- Higher inflation
- Lower inflation (or deflation)

Assets with lower volatility get a higher weighting in the portfolio. Bonds were the best performing asset over the last few decades and remarkably had the lowest volatility, so they get the highest weighting.
