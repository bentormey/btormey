### Introduction

I was never interested in finance when I was younger, I had no desire to make a lot of money or spend my time doing anything other than mathematics.

Financial mathematics was a passing curiosity, I read a couple of books on stochastic calculus and pricing options, but I never considered putting that knowledge into practise.

I was drawn to the theorems, not the idea of making a profit.

But I always saved money consistently, I even had a share ISA set up that gave me exposure to the stock market.

When 2008 hit and people were queuing up to withdraw cash from their banks, I found that I had less money in that ISA than when I started.

That soured me on investing in the stock market and I didn't think about it again for a long time.

### Passive vs. Active

When most people think about investing in stocks, they imagine buying shares of individual companies like Apple or Tesla.

Picking stocks, actively trading, using leverage...

The ROI on learning how to become a successful trader is low for most people.

Monetising your existing skillset through a job or your own business, generating cashflow to deploy in a passive strategy, is almost always better.

You could spend a lot of time and effort doing research on stocks, learning how to construct a portfolio around them, and managing your positions...

### Asset Classes

Restrict the universe of things you can invest in to asset classes, broadly speaking the ... ones I look at are:

- Stocks
- Bonds
- Gold
- Cash

There are others, including real estate, commodities (like oil), and cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin).

You don't need exposure to all of them, you only need a mix of assets which are not highly correlated with each other.

If you own property, you're already exposed to real estate. If you have a mortgage then you have _leveraged_ exposure to real estate.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are useful vehicles for getting exposure to these broad asset classes.

Stock ETFs track major indicies, like the S&P 500 or FTSE 100, and allow you to achieve the same returns as the market on the whole...

If large-cap US companies perform well, your S&P 500 index tracking ETF performs well...

If Apple represents 5% of the index then for every $100 you invest in the ETF, $5 goes towards buying Apple shares.

Bond ETFs hold a basket of bonds, which don't trade like stocks because 

Gold ETFs typically purchase gold in physical form, held via a custodian such as a bullion bank.

There are even real estate ETFs.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin aren't readily available in exchange-traded form (there's one Euro-denominated product by VanEck).

### The 'All Weather' Portfolio

The All Weather portfolio is built on the assumption that you can't know what kind of market regime will occur in the future, but you can allocate to assets that will perform well under each different regime.

It looks like this:

- 40% long-term bonds
- 30% stocks
- 15% intermediate-term bonds
- 7.5% gold
- 7.5% commodities

Each component is selected on it's ability to _weather_ one of the possible economic _seasons_:

- Rising economic growth
- Declining economic growth
- Higher inflation
- Lower inflation (or deflation)

Assets with lower volatility get a higher weighting in the portfolio. Bonds were the best performing asset over the last few decades and remarkably had the lowest volatility, so they get the highest weighting.

Historical returns and ETFs that allow you to recplicate the All Weather strategy can be found [here](http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/allocation/ray-dalio-all-weather/).

Make a note of the relatively mild drawdowns, this is an especially important feature if you're trying to preserve or grow wealth over longer time horizons: a loss of 10% and subsequent gain of 10%, leave you down 1% from where you started.

Now how do you put this together?

### Implementation



1. Set up a brokerage account and provide a source of funds.

2. Decide on your strategy (e.g. "60/40" or "All Weather").

3. Pick the ETFs that express your positions with the lowest management fees.

4. Take your starting capital and buy shares of each ETF in proportion they appear in your strategy.

5. Reinvest dividends and provide additional funds according to a schedule based on your income and expenses.

6. Rebalance periodically.

That last part is surprisingly important.

### The Rebalancing Premium

When your portfolio drifts away from your target allocation, in this case fixed percentages, you eventually have to _rebalance_.

Let's say you're following the All Weather strategy and equities have been performing really well, now making up 50% of your portfolio. You need to sell some to get back down to 30%. Likewise if gold has been underperforming and is now 5% of your portfolio, you need to buy a little bit more to get back to 7.5%.

Most articles on passive investing advise that you should rebalance yearly, but this is an error. If you only rebalance once a year, you're missing out on a *rebalancing premium* that can be harvested.

The rebalancing premium is also referred to as _Shannon's demon_ (like Maxwell's demon from thermodynamics), named after mathematician Claude Shannon. He is best known as the father of information theory and coined the term "bit" to describe a unit of digital information.

His idea was simple, but not intuitive: if you have a diverse collection of volatile assets which are not correlated with one another, you can profit from selling assets with gains to purchase assets with losses.

In other words if they move independently and don't all go up and down together, rebalancing will generate a positive return regardless of how the individual assets perform.

The returns are generated by the randomness itself.

There's research to suggest that rebalancing between three uncorrelated assets can produce a positive return from rebalancing alone. That means without any growth in the assets you're holding, you could achieve compound growth by rebalancing between them. You can [read more](https://investresolve.com/maximizing-the-rebalancing-premium-why-risk-parity-portfolios-are-much-greater-than-the-sum-of-their-parts-lp/) about that research if you're interested in the context.

With that concept fixed in your mind, let's finally look at cryptocurrency.

### Bitcoin



1-5%

Bitcoin with quarterly rebalancing



The point is that the volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin provides a source of rebalancing premium. Bitcoin has historically been uncorrelated with stocks and bonds, meaning that a 60/40 portfolio with a small allocation to Bitcoin outperformed the vanilla 60/40 portfolio.

If you put 95% in a mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds with the remaining 5% in Bitcoin, rebalancing every quarter, you would've outperformed the 60.
