**Hey, I'm Benjamin Tormey (the one on the right, in case you're wondering). I quit a mathematics PhD to rebalance my life, rebuild my body, and find freedom from depression.**

If you're feeling stuck and asking yourself:

* "How do I stop overthinking everything?"
* "How do I take take my emotions out of the process?"
* "I know what I should be doing, so why can't I get results?"
* "Maybe I have bad genetics?"
* "Maybe I'm just missing something!?"

**I'm here to help you filter out all the noise and focus on the stuff that matters.**

It's not about:

* Trying to optimise your macronutrient ratios.
* Reading all the latest studies but never applying basic principles.
* Spending more time thinking about your workouts than actually doing them.

It's about removing mental, emotional, and physical junk from your life.

Join my free newsletter and you'll get proven frameworks and strategies to master your mind, body, and impact every area of your life.

You'll get an email from me every week with my latest posts. No spam, ever.

You'll learn how to filter out the knowledge that doesn’t help you right now.

You'll create structure in your life that frees up your mental resources instead of restricting you.

And you'll spend less time thinking about small details that don’t matter - more time getting the important stuff done.
