I flew back to the UK for a few weeks in February.

I knew I'd be isolating in the house for 10 days, so I bought some games to play on my laptop to kill time. I did the same thing last summer under similar circumstances, except it was 14 days of isolation then.

When I was much younger, I was really addicted to gaming. I would stay up at night playing into the early hours of the morning, sometimes all the way through to the next day until I crashed.

Looking back on that period, I understand that it was because gaming was an escape for me. I felt deeply depressed, isolated, and I really didn't like who I was at all.

When I started changing the things I didn't like, I found that the appeal of gaming gradually fell away.

I didn't touch computer games or consoles at all for a decade after that.

Playing games again felt different this time. I still have the same tendencies towards being obsessive about completing them, but that's how I am with everything really. It was easy to put them away and forget about them when I was done.

It's no surprise to me that the research on addiction in mice finds that - whether it's heroin, cocaine, or sugar - your environment is critical.

When food is restricted and sugar is cut out, sugar intake will light up your brain like a drug. But take those restrictions away and it does nothing of the sort.

(I don't think the Instagram nutritionists haven't read that last bit, by the way.)

A year of lockdowns, work from home, and general soul crushing, has created a particularly brutal environment for maintaining good habits.

But you can do something about it.

You have to get to grips with your deepest desire for change.

Often the most powerful catalysts are traumatic events, like an injury, a health scare, or a broken relationship.

When it's a nagging discomfort in the background, you can suppress it for a long time.

And it's easier to go down the path of social media cures like self-acceptance and self-care without examining if it's something you can actually work on.

That's why many of the best results I've achieved were working with clients who were at their lowest point, not because I did anything different with them, but because they were desperate for change.

Remember that regardless of what restrictions they place around you on the outside, you don't have to be restricted inside your own head.

If you have that desire to change, there is always something you can do to make it happen, even if it's in small steps.
