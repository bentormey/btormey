## Interesting hook

### Ignore daily weight measurements, look at the trend

Your weight data is noisy.

If you've ever dieted before, you'll know that the scale does weird things. You'll wake up looking leaner and the scale says you haven't lost any weight.

Here are some common factors affecting your weight:

1. When you last went to the bathroom
2. How much food is in your digestive system
3. The amount of sodium in your food
4. How much water you drink
5. The amount of carbohydrate you consume

_Why should you track weight daily?_

Let's imagine your weight is a signal, varying continuously over time. Every time you step on the scale you're taking a sample, converting a continous signal into a discrete one.

In the same way that streaming music services compress audio by sampling it, you're compressing your continous weight data.

If you don't take enough samples, you lose important information.

The Nyquist-Shannon theorem tells us that we need a sample rate of at least two measurements per week (a sample rate of 2/7) to reconstruct the weekly weight variation.

Habit forming.
